When it comes to cards, making sure that the deck was not tampered in anyway is most important. To achieve this, PANGEA uses a method similar to coin shuffle and all participants are involved in the process and if just a single player is honest then the deck is properly shuffled.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00004"></a><span class="lineno">    4</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00005"></a><span class="lineno">    5</span>&#160;The problem with the other known methods for mental poker protocols are that they require a lot of bandwidth and are not as fast as PANGEA which uses a single curve25519 field multiply for the vast majority of its encrypt and decrypt functions. This creates an order of magnitude speedup and reduction of bandwidth required.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00006"></a><span class="lineno">    6</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00007"></a><span class="lineno">    7</span>&#160;The final requirement is to be able to recover from a player disconnect. Since all players are involved in the shuffling and decrypting process, if any player disconnects, there is no way to decrypt any more cards. Unless there is a backup method. By making commitment to the deck&#39;s pubkeys before start, it can be verified that the recovered deck was indeed the proper deck. Using Shamir&#39;s Shared Secret to distribute the shards to all the players, as a group MofN of the players are able to reconstruct any (or all) player&#39;s cards. Play can continue, albeit at a slower pace.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00008"></a><span class="lineno">    8</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00009"></a><span class="lineno">    9</span>&#160;Each hand (re)distributes the total funds the table has put into chips according to the result of each game. Under normal conditions, the majority of players sign an MofN multisig transaction to release the funds at the conclusion of a table. However, if more than N-M players refuse to sign, then the funds are not only not distributed correctly, they would be stuck. In the event where more than N-M players end up without any chips, they have no financial incentive to stay online to approve the MofN multisig transaction.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00010"></a><span class="lineno">   10</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00011"></a><span class="lineno">   11</span>&#160;One way to mitigate this is to have an MofN transaction signed after each round, so at most the result of a single game is unaccounted for. However, we still have the case of there being nobody left to cosign with the last man standing from financial self-interest. Also, it is common for online game players to simply disconnect out of frustration (admit it, you have done this too), so relying on the losing players to approve a payout to the winner is not likely to be reliable. Even if the MofN values are reduced as the number of players at the table is reduced can this be avoided as we certainly do not want to get to a 1of2 multisig for obvious reasons.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00012"></a><span class="lineno">   12</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00013"></a><span class="lineno">   13</span>&#160;The ideal solution is to have a blockchain enforced payout. This requires each change of gamestate to be recorded in the blockchain and the blockchain to be able to determine the proper allocation of funds. The method of doing a MofN after each game will reduce the blockchain bloat as only a game that doesnt have sufficient signers needs to be blockchain interpreted. The optimal is to use bi-directional multisig payment channels for normal play and have a backup blockchain mechanism that can be invoked by any single player in the event of the funds being stuck due to not enough signers.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00014"></a><span class="lineno">   14</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00015"></a><span class="lineno">   15</span>&#160;A totally separate issue is privacy, which in the case of online games is needed as some govts have decided that to protect women and children they need to make online gaming illegal. This has nothing to do with hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign financing and other funds paid by Las Vegas casinos to politicians. I am assured that it is purely to protect the innocents from, well, not sure what the online players are being protected from. So, I think a way to play privately is quite important. To that effect, the psock capability allows a single node to publish an IP address and if that node is not playing, but just participating in the creation of the card deck, it will allow all the other players to play in realtime without posting their IP address. By using JUMBLR secret funds to purchase chips, the identity of the source of the funds are not linked. If you are in a totalitarian regime that is monitoring your IP traffic, then unfortunately you would need to take further protective actions, ie. dont play from any IP address that can be correlated to you.</div><div class="line"><a name="l00016"></a><span class="lineno">   16</span>&#160;</div><div class="line"><a name="l00017"></a><span class="lineno">   17</span>&#160;As can be seen from the above, decentralized card games are one of the most difficult challenges in the crypto world and was unsolved, until PANGEA was released.
