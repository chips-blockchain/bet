Here we discuss the details about how we manage recovery and revocation authorities been used in bet ecosystem and also see some examples of how we creating them. 

So the question comes like do we use unique revocation/recovery authorities for every ID we maintain in the ecosystem or we maintain one revocation/recovery authority for a group a ID's or we use a single revocation/recovery authority for the entire bet ecosystem. At this point I'm unsure about whether we control revoke/recovery operations using multisig addresses or not. Lets consider a scanrio where in which we can only use single addresses as revoke/recovery authoroties in such case I feel its nice to have multiple revoke/recovery authorities.
