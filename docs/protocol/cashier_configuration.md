## Configuring the cashier nodes
These are the nodes elected by the community and these nodes play very crucial role in establishing the trust in the ecosystem. The configuration details of these nodes are found in `cashier_nodes.ini` which is located at the path `~/bet/privatebet/config`. These configuration settings can't be modified and changes made to it are ignored.

### To become a cashier node
The rules are not set yet, but there is a good discussion going on [here](https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/193). Please feel free to share your views on it. Atm, I'm(sg777) hosting few nodes as cashier nodes and using them, going forward its going to be changed.
